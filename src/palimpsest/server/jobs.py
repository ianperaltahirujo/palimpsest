"""In-process job registry and single-worker execution.

One `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)` for the whole process, not one
per job and not a process pool. The pipeline is blocking, CPU-bound
PyMuPDF work -- it must run off the asyncio event loop, but a local,
single-user tool has no reason to translate two documents at once (it
would just make both slower on typical hardware) and a single worker
keeps the machine responsive for whatever else the user is doing. No
Celery/Redis: that's infrastructure for a multi-worker hosted service,
the wrong weight entirely for one person's laptop.

Progress delivery: the worker thread calls the `progress` callback
synchronously from inside `translate_pdf_document`/
`translate_office_document` (see `core.progress`). Each call does a
plain `queue.Queue.put` -- thread-safe, and cheap enough to call from a
tight per-chunk loop. The SSE route drains that queue from the asyncio
side via `loop.run_in_executor`, so a blocking `queue.get()` never
stalls the event loop the rest of the app depends on.
