# Known limitations

An honest account of what this pipeline does not handle, drawn from a real
corpus run rather than written speculatively. None of these are silent --
each either degrades visibly (original Spanish left in place) or is
recorded in the run report.

## Text rotation is not reproduced

A source page with rotated column headers (seen in a real estate
comparables table) renders its translated headers horizontally rather
than at the source's rotation angle. Numeric data in the same table is
unaffected -- protected as digits, not re-laid-out.

## Inline emphasis mid-sentence is not preserved

A short bold lead-in label followed by regular body text (`CONSIDERANDO:`,
`Asunto:`) keeps its own styling, because `pdf.pipeline.translate_paragraph`
translates the label and the body as two separate units specifically to
preserve this pattern. Emphasis on a phrase *inside* a sentence -- an
italicised word mid-paragraph, say -- is not preserved: the whole sentence
is translated as one unit and drawn in its dominant style. Translating
arbitrary sub-sentence fragments separately was tried conceptually and
rejected -- it damages translation quality more than the emphasis loss is
worth, and risks reintroducing the isolated-fragment failure class
documented in [`protected-entities.md`](protected-entities.md).

## Bold-weight detection on scans is ~95% accurate

See [`bold-calibration.md`](bold-calibration.md) for the full fitting methodology and the
recall/false-positive tradeoff table. This is a measurement against pixels,
not a certainty.

## Very small text on scans is left in Spanish

Below `[thresholds].min_text_size_scan` (default 7pt), OCR confidence
degrades enough that a mistranslation is judged worse than leaving the
line untranslated. In practice this is almost always footer boilerplate
or a small-print address line, not body content.

## OCR occasionally reads noise out of decorative logos and brand graphics

A handful of instances (roughly a dozen across a real 40-document corpus)
where OCR extracted a short garbled fragment from a stylised logo or brand
graphic -- not real text at all -- and machine translation was then run on
that garbage. Confirmed narrow in scope: always on logo/stamp graphics,
never in body prose, and mostly harmless in practice (MT usually returns
nonsense input unchanged rather than confidently mistranslating it).
Deliberately not fixed: a real fix means detecting and excluding
logo/decorative-graphic regions from OCR entirely, which is a different
scope of engineering work than the fixes documented in
[`v1-postmortem.md`](v1-postmortem.md) and
[`protected-entities.md`](protected-entities.md). Accepted as a known,
narrow-impact gap rather than pursued.

## A stamp or seal overlapping real text defeats OCR region separation

Seen on one real financial-statement notes page, where an auditor's rubber
stamp physically overlapped the last line of a note. OCR has no concept of
"this pixel region is a non-text stamp, not a text line," so the two get
read as one garbled blob. Same underlying cause as the logo-noise
limitation above, and the same decision: not fixed, for the same
scope-of-work reason.

## The Spanish Tesseract model is the "fast" variant

The `spa` traineddata used is the compact `fast` variant (a few MB). The
`best` variant (an order of magnitude larger) would likely improve
recognition on degraded scans; it is not installed by default. Point
`[ocr].tessdata_prefix` at your own `best`-variant install if OCR quality
on poor scans matters more than setup size to you.

## English -> Spanish is a thinner path than Spanish -> English

The web UI lets each queued file choose English or Spanish as its target
(`translate.direction`). The backends, cache namespace and prompts are
direction-agnostic, so the translation itself works either way -- but the
tooling that was built around the original Spanish -> English corpus does
not run backwards, and is dropped (not inverted) for an English source:

- **Glossaries.** The bundled term lists are Spanish -> English. Inverting
  one is lossy (several Spanish terms share one English rendering), so an
  English -> Spanish file is translated with no glossary at all.
- **Post-rules.** The date fixups rewrite English month names and repair a
  "Santo Domingo" mistranslation; neither applies to Spanish output.
- **Legal ordinals.** `text.ordinals` peels Spanish ordinals ("DECIMO
  CUARTO") and re-attaches an English form. For an English source only the
  language-neutral list marker (`a)`, `2.`) is peeled.
- **OCR.** A scanned English document is OCR'd with Tesseract's `eng`
  pack (a Spanish source keeps the configured `[ocr].language`).
- **Command line.** `palimpsest translate --target es` applies the same
  direction rules to one file; `palimpsest batch` still uses the
  `[language]` pair from the config for every document.
- **Report wording.** The Results screen's labels still read "Kept
  Spanish" for any untranslated paragraph, whichever the source language.

Protected entities work identically in both directions.
